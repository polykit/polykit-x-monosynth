# Polykit X1 Semi Modular Synthesizer

This repository contains schematics, PCB layout files and front panel for an analog, semi modular, patchable synthesizer. It is an interface that works in conjunction with my voice card https://github.com/polykit/polykit-x-voice-card

Specs of the voice card:

* a VCO with saw, pulse and triangle signal
* an envelope generator
* a multimode filter with 8 different filter responses
* an external input
* and a panning stereo output

See voice card repository for a full feature list.

Specs of the semi modular interface:

* a LFO where the waveform can be blended between triangle and pulse signal
* a wave folder
* a two channel mixer where one input can be attenuated
* an additional attenuator
* a buffered multiple
* different offset voltages
* and a power supply
* 3D printable case
